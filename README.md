# Polygon Broadcaster Fee Demo

**My broadcaster fee estimation seems to be a bit off.**  

- **The Challenge:**  
  On a regular day (42 Gwei), unshielding costs me somewhere between **1–1.5 WPOL**, but the fee estimator is predicting something much more like **3.5-4 WPOL** for the same transaction

I hope this demo clears things up while keeping it light and easy to follow!

### Key Highlights  

1. **Ready to Go for Testing**  
   - No need to connect your own Railgun wallet. I've already set it up for smooth, worry-free testing 😊  
   - (I want you to rest easy knowing you did'nt input your wallet's details into fresh code)  
   - Currently configured for WPOL Fees on Polygon

2. **Simple and Streamlined**  
   - As my very first reproducible example, I've kept things minimal while including all the necessary details
