# Polygon Broadcaster Fee Demo

**My broadcaster fee estimation seems to be a bit off.**  

- **Example:**  
  This unshield here [Polygon Tx: 0x350041a4700413d3bf3d36e11e7f4e4a2c13a3f832d375201d9289a1d76af385](https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x350041a4700413d3bf3d36e11e7f4e4a2c13a3f832d375201d9289a1d76af385) is by me with my railgun build.
  My broadcaster fees claimed it'll be 0.168 WPOL for the unshield... but in reality; I had 1.041 WPOL reducded from railgun wallet in fees (the network fee was only 0.6 POL).

I hope this demo clears things up while keeping it light and easy to follow!
